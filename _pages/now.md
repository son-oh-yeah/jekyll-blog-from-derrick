### Traveling

Back to Japan secondary. It truly lives up to its reputation for peace and beauty‚Äîjust like in the media. I was blown away by the perfectly organized traffic, smartly designed buildings, and how everything seemed to flow with logic and artistry. The payment systems? Next level! Everything is so synchronized and convenient, with self-service machines that are super smart. But oddly enough, I felt a bit of sadness (or maybe boredom) in Tokyo and [the places]({{ site.url }}/library/#2023) I visited. It felt like they could use a bit more color to brighten things up!

### Aspirations for 2024

- Build a channel for sharing about designing digital products in the financial industry.
- Read more [books]({{ site.url }}/blog) about Art and Product management.
- Travel more with my family. Drive my little princess to explore more places.

### Works

- I moved to a new role as a product designer at a digital bank in Vietnam.
- Creating my first project to show the invisible things in psychology and understanding how the brain works.
- As part of my responsibilities, I'm designing the Customer Experience (CX) for the onboarding journey, guiding users from the 'New' phase to the pre-loyalty stage. 
- I'm working with our Data team to develop a recommendation platform based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis framework, delivering customer personalization and user engagement solutions.
