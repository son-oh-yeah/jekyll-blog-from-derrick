This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" class="evidence">now page</a>. Updated on March 20, 2024, from Hanoi, Vietnam.

### Reading

Start read ["The making of a Manager"](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html)--Julie Zhuo. I will write summary about this book when finish.

### Traveling

I visited Japan in November 2023 to join Coldplay's Liveshow ["Music of the Spheres World Tour"](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzdpDekxlcL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)-they're my favorite band. I felt and enjoyed that moment, so great, and Oh Yeahhh üôå.

Japan truly lives up to its reputation for peace and beauty‚Äîjust like you see in the media. I was blown away by the perfectly organized traffic, smartly designed buildings, and how everything seems to flow with both logic and artistry. The payment systems? Next level! Everything is so synchronized and convenient, with self-service machines that are super smart. But oddly enough, I felt a bit of sadness (or maybe boredom) in Tokyo and [the places]({{ site.url }}/library/#2023) I visited. It felt like they could use a bit more color to brighten things up!

### Aspirations for 2024
- Build a channel for sharing about designing digital products in the financial industry.
- Read more [books]({{ site.url }}/blog) about Art and Product management.
- Travel more with my family. Drive my little princess to explore more places.

### Works
#### 2024
- My next chapter focuses on being a product designer at a digital banking company in Vietnam.
- I'll be working on my first project, integrating insights on financial behavior into product design.
- CX Design the customer onboarding experience, from the "New" stage through to the pre-loyalty stage.
