### Reading

### Traveling

I visited Japan in November 2023 to join Coldplay's Liveshow ["Music of the Spheres World Tour"](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzdpDekxlcL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)-they're my favorite band. I felt and enjoyed that moment, so great, and Oh Yeahhh üôå.

Japan truly lives up to its reputation for peace and beauty‚Äîjust like you see in the media. I was blown away by the perfectly organized traffic, smartly designed buildings, and how everything seems to flow with both logic and artistry. The payment systems? Next level! Everything is so synchronized and convenient, with self-service machines that are super smart. But oddly enough, I felt a bit of sadness (or maybe boredom) in Tokyo and [the places]({{ site.url }}/library/#2023) I visited. It felt like they could use a bit more color to brighten things up!
