Hi üëã, my name is Kevin Kim, and I have been a Product designer in the *gaming*, *IT software services*, and *digital banking industry* since 2016.

As [a practitioner of the Design Thinking method](https://www.credly.com/badges/d7ba6db5-ff1a-42e8-b854-ae6d3e8028a8), my tagline is to pursue minimalism to understand myself and people deeply from intrinsic. The innovation outcomes always come from a simple foundation.

> _"If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"_--Albert Einstein.

**My dream and career**

In high school, I was fascinated by the beauty of elementary mathematics (especially Geometry and Combinatorics) and wished to become a mathematician.

I majored in computer science at university, dreaming of making great products like Facebook, Google, or Apple ü´†.

I started as a mobile app game designer for three years. Thanks to that, I know the fields of **user experience design** and analytical perspectives on customer psychology and behavior. That intrigued me and made me curious to explore further. My first favorite book in gaming design is ["On the Way to Fun: An Emotion-Based Approach to Successful Game Design"](https://www.amazon.com/Way-Fun-Emotion-Based-Approach-Successful/dp/1568815824), it showed me the difference between buying and making. That is how to build with mind and love, make with skills and tools.

In recent years, I have worked in the field of Digital Product Design in the finance/banking industry and consulted for several blockchain projects. I have been viewing financial pictures from the micro to the macro, gradually understanding how our world operates and the things that affect the behavior and decisions of each person, group of people, or country. It's too BIG üòÇ. 
Now, I'm studying psychology behavior to understand how customers buy and make decisions. My most interested topic is [Bias in Product Design](/research/2023-12-13-bias).

I still dreamed of my dream when I was a kid-an artist üßë‚Äçüé®. That can help me answer <a style="text-decoration: underline;text-underline-offset: 0.6ex;text-decoration-style: wavy;text-decoration-color: #6b69fa">"Who am I?"</a>question.

**Build my blog**

I'd like to share and archive the knowledge of design in life, and what things I observed and enlightened. Write more to reflect and improve myself about the experiences, perceptions, and discovered things.

**Music for life**

My most fav track is ‚ô´ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7LVHVU3tWfcxj5aiPFEW4Q?si=bb571cb38d7b4565" style="text-decoration: underline;text-underline-offset: 0.6ex;text-decoration-style: wavy;text-decoration-color: #6b69fa">"Fix you"</a> by Coldplay.

My musical flavor leans a bit toward the alternative rock genre of Coldplay, The Killers, or Imagine Dragons. The music has an electronic touch with vibrant themes while still feeling the depth of the soul. I also like some Vietnam traditional songs.

## [Now](#now)
This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" class="evidence">now page</a>. Updated on March 20, 2024, from Hanoi, Vietnam.

### Reading

Start read ["The making of a Manager"](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html)--Julie Zhuo. I will write summary about this book when finish.

### Traveling

I visited Japan in November 2023 to join Coldplay's Liveshow ["Music of the Spheres World Tour"](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzdpDekxlcL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)-they're my favorite band. I felt and enjoyed that moment, so great, and Oh Yeahhh üôå.

Everything in Japan is as peaceful and beautiful as people say and through the media. I am genuinely impressed by the neatness and strategic planning of traffic and the architecture of the buildings. Everything has logic and an artistic connection. I also impressed by the payment services, The synchronization of service systems makes everything convenient; self-service machines are always available and very smart.
However, I felt slightly sad (may be boring) in Tokyo and the places I visited. I guess there need more some colours.
