Hi, my name is Kevin Kim, and I have been a Product designer in the **gaming**, **IT software services**, and **digital banking industry** since 2016.

As [a practitioner of the Design Thinking method](https://www.credly.com/badges/d7ba6db5-ff1a-42e8-b854-ae6d3e8028a8), my tagline is to pursue minimalism to understand myself and people deeply from intrinsic. The innovation outcomes always come from a simple foundation.

**My dream and career**

In high school, I was fascinated by the beauty of elementary mathematics (especially Geometry and Combinatorics) and wished to become a mathematician in the future.

I majored in computer science at university, dreaming of making great products like Facebook, Google, or Apple ü´†.

I started as a mobile app game designer for three years. Thanks to that, I had access to the fields of **user experience design** and analytical perspectives on customer psychology and behavior. That intrigued me and made me curious to explore further. In recent years, I have worked in the field of Digital Product Design in the finance/banking industry and consulted for several blockchain projects.

I still dreamed of my dream when I was a kid-an artist üßë‚Äçüé®. That can help me answer <a style="text-decoration: underline;text-underline-offset: 0.6ex;text-decoration-style: wavy;text-decoration-color: #6b69fa">"Who am I?"</a>.


**Building [My Blog]({{ site.url }}/blog)**

I'd like to share and archive the knowledge of design in life, and what things I observed and enlightened. Write more articles on Medium to reflect and improve myself about the experiences, perceptions, and discovered things.
