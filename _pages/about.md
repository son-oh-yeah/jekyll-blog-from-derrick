Hi, my name is Kevin Kim, and I have been a Product designer in the gaming, IT software services, and digital banking industry since 2016.

> As a practitioner of the Design Thinking method, my tagline is to pursue minimalism to understand myself and people deeply from intrinsic. The innovation outcomes always come from **a simple foundation**.

> _"If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"_--Albert Einstein.
