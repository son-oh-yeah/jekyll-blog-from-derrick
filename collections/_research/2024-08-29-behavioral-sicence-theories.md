## Acceptance Research
From 2 view sociology and psychology:
![The main steps in the history of acceptance research](/assets/img/research/history-of-acceptance-research.png)

- Diffusion Theory
- Theory of Planned Behaviour
- Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
- Unified Theory (UTAUT)
- Resistance Model 
- Fogg Behaviour Model

## Diffusion Theory
The diffusion of innovations theory is a hypothesis outlining how new technological and other advancements spread throughout societies and cultures, from introduction to widespread adoption. The diffusion of innovations theory seeks to explain how and why new ideas and practices are adopted, including why the adoption of new ideas can be spread out over long periods.

## Theory of Planned Behaviour
The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) aka Theory of Reasoned Action was developed by Icek Ajzen as an attempt to predict human behavior (Ajzen, 1991). The TPB posits that attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control influence behavioral intention.

## Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
Developed by Fred D. Davis in 1989. Extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen & Fishbein 1980).
Predicts individual adoption and use of new technologies in a work context
Intention to use new technology is based on 2 factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

## Unified Theory (UTAUT)
The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a technology acceptance model formulated by Venkatesh and others in "User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view".

- UTAUT2: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401220314687 

Field of Application:
- Use of various technologies within an organization (UTAUT 1): focus on Expectation of performance, Expectation of effort, Social influence, Facilitating conditions
- Use of various technologies within the consumer market (UTAUT 2): focus on Hedonic motivation, Price value, Habit

## Resistance Model
Developed by MacVaugh and Schiavone in 2010

## Fogg Behaviour Model
The Fogg Behavior Model shows that three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt/Trigger.
