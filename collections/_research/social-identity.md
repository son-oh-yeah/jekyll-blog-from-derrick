I published an article about digital Social Indentity experience [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-social-identity-why-you-should-own-blockchain-kim-dinh-son). There are my conclusions:

> An online communication platform (Community Online) needs user identification to serve the management and response of online utilities. 
In addition, the challenges that the platform for Online Communities needs to meet to help users stay close and trusted with relatives or friends, safety when communicating with strangers, simplifying the experience in using and managing your online identity, and a personal show-off to stand out in the online community. 
Using Wallet ID helps prevent catfishing profiles on Community Online and simplifies all identity verification issues, safety, and convenience.

## The key problems need to solve
**How to be close and trustworthy with acquaintances/friends?**
- I want people to remember my name easily.
- My name is authenticated, not to be confused with others.

**How to be safe when communicating with strangers?**
- I want to remain anonymous and not reveal all personal information; they cannot know who I am and what I look like, and my style and preferences must be kept confidential.

**How might we simplify account usage with less management effort and identification of concerns with online platforms?**
- I want to pay for convenient transactions like Apple Pay, Xbox points, or even a credit card.
- Users want to use the same username across multiple devices in a trustless manner.

**How to show me to the community so people quickly know me?**
- I want to make an impression.
- I want to make it simple and easy to remember.

## Trending of digital social identity

With the current development trend, in the future, every user will own a crypto wallet. Nowaday, **Trust contacts** is the primary solution for every web3 platform/Dapps.
- **Chat name (Display name)**: The default for all Ready users instead of displaying the chat key is long and difficult to read; the user must make much effort to check when trying to authenticate a message for a new contact. It is necessary to propose a form of chat name that is easy to read, easy to check, and still ensures uniqueness. For example, display a Random name with three letters instead of the chat key.
- **Nickname**: User can give a nickname to any user in the contact to easily remember and identify that contact. If that contact has not been nicknamed, it is displayed with a Random name.
- **Short name**: a more "human-readable name" and more accessible, especially high authenticity because a reputable third-party service provides it. ENS name provides a solution for the chat key when chat will replace a Random name to display to others, so other people can easily search for a user relying on ENS name services unless they choose to hide from search.
